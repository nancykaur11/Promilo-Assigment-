This code represents a basic React application with user authentication using React Router and API calls. Below is a breakdown of the key components and functionalities:

### Routing Setup:
The application uses react-router-dom for handling routing.
There are two main components: App and AuthenticatedApp.
The App component defines the overall structure, routes, and protected routes using ProtectedRoute.
The AuthenticatedApp component is the authenticated part of the application, rendering the main content when the user is logged in.

### Login Component:
The Login component is responsible for user login.
It includes form inputs for email and password, and it performs basic client-side validation for email format and password complexity.
Upon successful validation, it sends a POST request to an authentication endpoint using Axios.
If authentication is successful, it stores the access token in local storage and navigates to the authenticated part of the application.

### ProductDetails Component:
The ProductDetails component fetches and displays product details.
It uses the access token stored in local storage for authentication in the API request.
It includes a search functionality to filter products based on the user's input.

### Navbar Component:
The Navbar component displays a simple navigation bar with a logo, Home, About, and Logout links.
The navigation links are conditionally rendered based on the current route using react-router-dom and useLocation.
The Logout link clears the authentication token from local storage.

### Additional Notes:
The application uses SHA-256 hashing for password security before sending it to the authentication endpoint.
The authentication token is stored in local storage for subsequent API requests.
Axios is used for making HTTP requests to the authentication and product details endpoints.
The application UI  uses Bootstrap classes for styling.




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
